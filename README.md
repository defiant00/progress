### Animals

Have ages and will eventually die of old age. Have individual knowledge and skills
that are passed on by working with others. Schools can provide education more
quickly to groups.

### Races

Have different stats and are good at different things.

* Cats - high curiosity
* Dogs - all-rounder?
* Snakes - low dex

### Events

Events require (?) a choice.  
Eg, "Scouts have reported shadowy figures, what should they do?"
  "Leave an offering"  
  "Try to capture one"

### Science

Pick general activity that then has a chance of unlocking specific areas of study.

* bang rocks together
  * some rocks consistently break others
    * study and categorize rock hardness
      * use harder rocks to make better tools
  * some rocks bend rather than break
    * investigate the properties of metals
      * lots of potential enhancements
* try mixing things in with kibble
